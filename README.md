## Deep Learning Challenge
Module 21 Challenge- Deep Learning

## Project Description: 
This is the assignment submission for challenge #21- Deep Learning Challenge. This assignment involves usage of Tensorflow to create a neural network model that can predict the outcome of foundation grants to organizations

### Getting Started and Installation: 
To view and run the neural network training code, view Starter_Code and Starter_code_Optimized. The actual models are saved as AlphabetSoupCharity and AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization. 

### The following are uploaded to Github:
- All Original Files
- Starter Code and Model, and Optimized versions of each
- Report.md, to discuss findings with the neural network models
- Images folder, to aid in the report file

### Contributors: 
Christopher Yang

### Acknowledgements: 
I would like to thank the University of Toronto for putting together a robust program for Data Analytics, my fellow classmates as well as the wonderful Instructors and LAs at the University of Toronto for their support.
